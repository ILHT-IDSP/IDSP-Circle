This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Database Setup

This project uses Prisma as ORM with a PostgreSQL database. To set up a local database with sample data, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a PostgreSQL database running and your `.env` file contains the correct `DATABASE_URL`.
2. Run migrations to create the database schema:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

3. Seed the database with sample data:

```bash
npm run db:seed
```

This will populate the database with users, circles, music, posts, comments, likes, and other related data for testing and development purposes. The seed script is located at `prisma/seed.ts`.
