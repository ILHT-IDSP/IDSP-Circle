// This file has been deprecated as middleware is now applied directly in prisma.ts
// The functionality has been moved to the createPrismaClient function in prisma.ts
//
// This file is kept for reference purposes but is no longer being used
//
// The original middleware implementation has been integrated directly into
// the Prisma client creation process before applying the Accelerate extension,
// as middleware needs to be applied before extensions.
